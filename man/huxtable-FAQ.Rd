A FAQ of common issues.
}
\details{
LaTeX output isn't working.
\itemize{
\item Have you installed the LaTeX packages you need? LaTeX packages are different from R packages.
Run \code{check_latex_dependencies()} to find out if you are missing any. Then install them
using your system's LaTeX management application. Or you can try \code{install_latex_dependencies()}.
}

Numbers in my cells look weird!
\itemize{
\item You can change numeric formatting using \code{\link[=number_format]{number_format()}}. Base R options like
\link[base:options]{"scipen"} usually have no effect.
}

I ran \code{caption(ht) <- "Something"} and got an error message:\preformatted{Error in UseMethod("caption<-") :
no applicable method for 'caption<-' applied to an object of class "c('huxtable', 'data.frame')"
}
\itemize{
\item You may have loaded another package with a \code{caption} method, e.g. "xtable". Try loading
huxtable after xtable.
}

My tables aren't centered correctly (LaTeX).
\itemize{
\item Try adjusting \code{width(ht)}.
}

I have another problem.
\itemize{
\item If you think it's a bug - i.e. a problem with the software - please report it to
https://github.com/hughjonesd/huxtable/issues. Otherwise, ask a question on
\href{https://stackoverflow.com}{StackOverflow} or https://community.rstudio.com. That
way, other people will benefit from the answers you get.
}

Can I email you directly?
\itemize{
\item I'd rather you asked on a public website. If you then email me a link, I may be able to help.
