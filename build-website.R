# pkgdown works from your tree, not from installed versions.
# But rmarkdown::render works with installed versions.
# So:
# check pkgdown:::pkg_timeline("huxtable") includes the new version
#   (otherwise, it'll be marked as 'unreleased' in the news page)
# checkout the version that you want on the web
# Install the package and restart
# create a branch if there isn't one (git checkout -b website-x.y.z)
# update index.Rhtml appropriately
# run this script;
# commit any changes and push to github;
# checkout master;
# merge in the new branch (git merge website-x.y.z)
# push to github
